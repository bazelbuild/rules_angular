# Don't create bazel-* symlinks in the WORKSPACE directory.
# These require .gitignore and may scare users.
# Also, it's a workaround for https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript/issues/12
# which affects the common case of having `tsconfig.json` in the WORKSPACE directory.
#
# Instead, you should run `bazel info` to find out where the outputs went.
